# Tentris
Implemented over the weekend just for fun.
This is an unfinished concept.
Someday I will write a normal and complete implementation.

In theory, the 3 digits next to each other add up to the next number. The challenge is to get clean 10.

Be careful, it can turn your device into a griddle.
